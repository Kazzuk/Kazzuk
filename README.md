### Hello there, I'm [Adam](https://github.com/Kazzuk/Kazzuk) :wave:

I'm a very passionate person about learning new things especially from others as much as helping others solve problems. I'm currently busy furthering my career to be a software engineer at [Queen's University](https://www.qub.ac.uk). Most important of all I'm fun to work with. :smile:
